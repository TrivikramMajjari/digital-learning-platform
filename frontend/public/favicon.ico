The favicon.ico file is a binary file that represents the icon for your web application. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, I will provide a placeholder comment indicating that this file should contain the favicon image.

Here are the contents for the file:

/digital-learning-platform/digital-learning-platform/frontend/public/favicon.ico

<!-- This file is intentionally left blank. Please replace it with your favicon image file. -->
